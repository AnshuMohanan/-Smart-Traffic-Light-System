A complete system that leverages the YOLOv8 object detection model to count the number of people waiting to cross a street and intelligently controls a physical pedestrian crossing signal (Red/Green LEDs) connected to an ESP8266. The communication between the computer vision script and the microcontroller is handled seamlessly over a serial connection.

## About The Project

This project bridges the gap between high-level computer vision and physical hardware control. It provides a practical solution for automating pedestrian management systems, such as activating crosswalk signals on demand or managing foot traffic flow at building entrances.

The system uses a webcam or video file as input.A Python script running the powerful YOLOv8 model detects and tracks individuals within a user-defined **Region of Interest (ROI)**.The real-time count of people is then sent to an ESP8266 microcontroller, which executes a timer-based logic to manage a red ("Don't Walk") and a green ("Walk") LED. The timer's duration dynamically adjusts based on the number of people detected, making the system efficient and responsive.For example, a larger group of people will get the "Walk" signal faster than a single individual.

## Key Features

- **üëÄ Real-Time Person Detection**: Utilizes the state-of-the-art **YOLOv8n model** for fast and accurate detection and tracking of people.
- **üñ±Ô∏è Interactive ROI Selection**: An easy-to-use interface allows you to draw a detection zone directly on the video feed, which is then saved for future use.
- **üîå Seamless Serial Communication**: Reliably transmits the person count from the Python script to the ESP8266 using the `PySerial` library.
- **üí° Dynamic Timer Logic**: The ESP8266 code implements a smart timer that adjusts its duration based on the number of people detected‚Äîmore people result in a shorter wait time for the "Walk" signal.
- **‚öôÔ∏è Standalone & Robust**: The system is designed to run continuously.The Python script handles video stream errors, and the ESP8266 manages the LED states independently once it receives a count.
- **üîß Easy to Test**: Includes multiple helper scripts for isolated component testing.
    - `esp8266check_code.py`: Tests the serial communication with the ESP8266.
    - `webcamtest.py`: Verifies basic camera functionality with OpenCV.
    - `test2.py`: Confirms that the YOLOv8 model is installed and running correctly on the webcam feed.

## System Architecture

The system's workflow creates a one-way data pipeline from visual input to physical output.

1.  **Video Input**: The Python script captures video from a webcam or a file using **OpenCV**.
2.  **ROI Definition**: On the first run, the user draws a rectangle on a frame to define the waiting area where people should be counted.This ROI is saved in a `roi.json` file.
3.  **Detection & Counting**: For each frame, the **YOLOv8 model** processes the video to detect and track individuals.The script counts only those whose bounding boxes have a significant overlap (>=50%) with the defined ROI.
4.  **Serial Transmission**: Whenever the number of people in the zone changes, the Python script sends the new count as a string to the ESP8266 over the specified serial (COM) port.
5.  **Hardware Control**:
    * The **ESP8266** continuously listens for incoming serial data.
    * If `personCount > 0`, it turns on the **RED LED** (signifying "Don't Walk") and starts a timer.The timer's duration is inversely proportional to the `personCount` (e.g., 1 person = 90s, 4 people = 30s).
    * When the timer expires, it turns off the RED LED and turns on the **GREEN LED** (signifying "Walk").
    * The system fully resets (both LEDs off) only when it receives a `personCount` of `0`.

### Hardware Setup & Circuit



Wire the components according to the image provided and the pin definitions in the code.

**Connect your components as shown in the table below:**

| Component Pin   | Pin (ESP8266) | Purpose                |
|---------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Red LED Anode   | D1 (GPIO 5)   | Red Light (Don't Walk) |
| Green LED Anode | D2 (GPIO 4)   | Green Light (Walk)     |
| Red LED Cathode | GND           | Ground                 |
| Green LED Cathode| GND          | Ground                 |

*Note: The circuit diagram and an image of the physical setup are available in the `media` folder for reference.*

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/AnshuMohanan/-Smart-Traffic-Light-System.git](https://github.com/AnshuMohanan/-Smart-Traffic-Light-System.git)
    cd -Smart-Traffic-Light-System
    ```

2.  **ESP8266 Setup**
    1.  Open `traffic_light.ino` in the Arduino IDE.
    2.  Go to **Tools > Board** and select your ESP8266 board (e.g., "NodeMCU 1.0 (ESP-12E Module)").
    3.  Select the correct COM port under **Tools > Port**.
    4.  Click the "Upload" button to flash the code to the board.

3.  **Python Environment Setup**
    1.  It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment:
        ```sh
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
        ```
    2.  Install all the required packages:
        ```sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

## Usage

1.  **Connect the Hardware**: Plug the ESP8266 into your computer via USB. Note the COM port it is assigned (e.g., `COM3` on Windows, `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux). You can find this in the Arduino IDE under **Tools > Port**.

2.  **Run the Main Script**: Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run `FINALCODE_C_test.py` with the required arguments.
    * `--source`: Use `'0'` for your primary webcam or provide a path to a video file.
    * `--port`: The COM port your ESP8266 is connected to.

    **Example for Webcam:**
    ```sh
    python FINALCODE_C_test.py --source 0 --port COM3
    ```

    **Example for a Video File:**
    ```sh
    python FINALCODE_C_test.py --source "path/to/your/video.mp4" --port COM3
    ```

3.  **Define the ROI**:
    * If this is your first time running the script, a window titled "Select ROI" will appear.
    * **Click and drag** your mouse to draw a rectangle over the area you want to monitor.
    * Press the **`c`** key to confirm and save the ROI.The detection will then begin.
    * On subsequent runs, the script will ask if you want to **(U)se** the existing ROI or **(D)efine** a new one.

4.  **Observe the System**:
    * A window will show the live video feed with bounding boxes around detected people in the zone and a counter.
    * The LEDs on your breadboard will change according to the logic described in the **System Architecture**.
    * The terminal will print messages indicating the connection status and the counts being sent to the ESP8266.
    * Press **`q`** to stop the program.This will also send a `0` to the ESP8266 to reset the lights.
